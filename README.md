# Decision Tree Model for Iris Dataset

## Title
Simple Decision Tree Classifier for Iris Dataset

## Description
This Python script demonstrates a straightforward implementation of a Decision Tree classifier using the popular Iris dataset. The Decision Tree is trained on a subset of the data, and its accuracy is evaluated on a test set. The resulting tree structure is visually presented for easy interpretation.

## Model of the AI
The model utilizes the scikit-learn library, specifically the `DecisionTreeClassifier` class. This classifier is trained to predict the species of iris flowers based on their sepal and petal characteristics.

## Inference
The script outputs the accuracy of the Decision Tree on the test set, providing a measure of its performance. Additionally, a graphical representation of the Decision Tree is displayed, allowing users to inspect the decision-making process.

## Generate and Test
- **Explore the Dataset and confirm that it is accurately being created using Decision Tree.**
